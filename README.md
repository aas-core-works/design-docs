# Design Docs for aas-core

This collection of documents captures the design decisions we made while discussing and designing the aas-core library.

The documentation is available on https://aas-core-works.github.io/design-docs/.

## A Note about Validity

Their first and foremost aim is to kick-start the development and guide the initial implementation.
The documents will not be continuously updated once we start with the development.
However, they are still useful for the future developers!
For example, parts of the code might be clearer when the initial design decisions are considered.
