# Naming Conventions

All identifiers should use snake-case.
The abbreviations should be in upper case, all other letters in lower case.

We need this particular casing so that we can adapt the casing and variables to individual languages.
For example, Python uses `snake_case` for properties, but `CamelCase` for classes.
Golang style guide expect abbreviations to be upper case (`ParseXML`), while C# style guide wants camel case (`ParseXml`).
